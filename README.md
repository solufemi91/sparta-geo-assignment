1.       Write webserver with a REST API to get the notes for a device. This will need to parse the xml and return the appropriate notes given device name as a parameter of the REST call
2.       Write a test script to test the operation of the webserver
3.       Wrap this script in a unit test framework
4.       Enhance the test script to explore the result of verbs other than ‘get’ (which should fail)
5.       Enhance the webserver and tests to return all devices
